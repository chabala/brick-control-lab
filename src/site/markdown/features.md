## Features

* Output control
    * on and off
    * change power level
    * change direction
    * control outputs individually or as groups
* Stop button monitoring
    * can handle pressing and releasing events separately
* Input monitoring
    * Raw values can be obtained
    * Touch sensor handling can discern pressed vs not pressed

### Compatible elements

Many LEGO 9 volt elements are compatible with the control lab, mainly determined by their electrical connection. The
classic 9 volt connector looks like a 2x2x2/3 brick with electric contacts on the studs. Power Functions motors and
lights are also compatible, and can be connected by using the [Power Functions Extension Wire 8886](
https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-power-functions-extension-wire-8886). Incompatible elements are from the later
control systems: NXT, EV3, Powered Up, Boost, and Control+.

For a good overview of LEGO motors see [Philippe Hurbain's motor comparison](

For a good overview of other compatable elements and sensors, see [Tom Cook's website](

### Working with multiple control labs

Multiple control labs can be used together for larger projects, limited only by the amount of serial ports one
has to connect to them with.

The source code for this example is in [MultipleControlLabIT](
xref-test/org/chabala/brick/controllab/MultipleControlLabIT.html#L122) as the `testOperatingInTandem()` test.

### Roadmap for future development

* Improved sensor handling and calibration of interpreted values
    * Light and temperature sensors need more analysis
    * Rotation sensor not attempted yet
    * Potential for third party RCX sensor support
* Additional command support for the outputs
    * native blink support
* stateful tracking of outputs
* virtual control lab hardware for simulation or testing against
